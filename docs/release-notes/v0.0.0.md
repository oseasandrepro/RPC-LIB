## 1. Features
- **Simple API** for exposing and calling remote procedures.
- **Interface definition through Python conventions** (no separate IDL required).
- **Plug-and-play architecture** — install and start implementing immediately.
- **Remote exception propagation**
- **Stub generation** for server and client.
- **Live metrics dashboard**, displaying call count and latency per procedure.


## 2. Architectural & Usability Enhancements
- ***Simplified Server Setup:*** The server's initialization is greatly simplified by encapsulating all binder logic (thread management, start, stop) within the generated SrpcServerStub.

- ***Clean Naming Convention:*** A project-wide convention was implemented, changing the name from 'rpc' to 'srpc' (Simple RPC) in all library and generated files for improved clarity.

- ***Modular Architecture:*** The project was reorganized to separate client and server logic into distinct directories, enhancing modularity.

## 3. Stability and Quality Assurance
- ***Networking Stability:*** Resolved a critical networking bug (Issue #3) by implementing socket-to-port 0 binding, which delegates port selection to the operating system, eliminating the need for conflict checking.

- ***Reliable Exception Instantiation:*** Fixed a bug (Issue #1) related to remote exception rehydration by ensuring the exception type (exc_name) is correctly included in the 400 response, allowing the client-side eval() to correctly instantiate the remote class.

- ***Continuous Integration (CI):*** An automated CI pipeline was established to run Pytest (unit and integration tests) upon every push, ensuring code quality standards are met.

- ***Code Style Enforcement:*** Adopted pre-commit hooks utilizing Black, Flake8, and isort to enforce a consistent and high-quality coding style across the project.

- ***Improved Logging:*** Standardized logging practices using the lightweight Python logging library, including the use of specific exceptions, proper error logging, and custom exception classes.

- ***Non-Impactful Metrics:*** Latency measurement was designed to write metrics to a file, this approach was chosen to avoid impacting server performance.

## 4. Scope Clarification
Protocol Adherence: In this version, the project has consciously decided not to strictly adhere to RFC 1057 (Sun RPC).<br>SRPC is positioned as a prototyping and academic library rather than a production-ready system, allowing for faster<br> development and distributed systems principles.

## 5. Expansion Possibilities
- ***Performance Benchmarking*** — Implement comprehensive tests and metrics<br>(e.g., latency, throughput, resource utilization) to enable users to evaluate real-world behavior.
- ***Security Review*** — Analysis of serialization, transport layers, failure modes, in order to turn the library for broader deployment.
- ***Authentication & Authorization Layers*** — Provide mechanisms for authentication and access control, enabling secure RPC

## 6. A History of Closed Issues to reach V0.0.0
This timeline reflects the project's maturation from its early stages to a more robust and organized state.

### Phase I: Addressing Core Stability and Infrastructure (May–August 2025)
The initial phase focused on building a stable foundation, resolving critical bugs, and setting up the basic development workflow.

### 1. Critical Bug Resolution
Two critical issues concerning stability and network binding were resolved early in the project’s life:

#### Issue #3: Server stub try bind the same port for different procedures (Fixed: August 2, 2025): 
This fundamental networking bug was resolved by adopting an elegant solution: binding the socket to port 0.<br>
This delegates the responsibility of choosing an available, unassigned port to the operating system,<br>
eliminating the need for custom random port generation and conflict checking.

#### Issue #1: Exception when make 'exc_class = eval(exc_name)' (Fixed: August 2, 2025): 
This bug related to remote exception propagation was fixed by ensuring the exception type (exc_name) was correctly included in the 400 response,<br>
allowing the client side's eval() function to correctly instantiate the remote exception class.

### 2. Project Reorganization and CI/CD Implementation
Key structural and pipeline decisions were made to prepare the project for scaling:

#### Issue #7: Reorganize the project (August 2–3, 2025):
The repository was reorganized to separate client and server logic into distinct directories, improving modularity.<br> 
The core generation script, `srpc_stub_gen.py`, was also modularized.

#### Issue #8: Add git workflow - PipeLine for CI/CD (Completed: September 4, 2025):
A Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline was established. The author successfully implemented a workflow that executes Pytest<br>
for both unit and integration tests upon every push, ensuring code changes meet quality standards before merging.

### Phase II: Enhancing Quality, Logging, and Protocol Decisions (August–September 2025)
With the foundation stable, development shifted to code quality, developer experience, and defining the project's scope.

### 1. Code Quality and Style
The commitment to clean code was formalized through automated tools:

#### Issue #10: Consider use pre-commit (Completed: September 10, 2025):
This enhancement resulted in the adoption of pre-commit hooks utilizing three essential Python tools:<br>
Black (uncompromising code formatter), Flake8 (linting and PEP 8 enforcement), and isort (import sorting).<br>
This enforced a consistent coding style across all commits.

### 2. Observability and Error Handling
Better logging was a persistent focus, evolving through two issues:

#### Issue #2 & #4 (Completed: August 8, 2025): 
These intertwined issues focused on improving error handling and logging.<br>
The solution involved implementing five best practices: using specific exceptions, proper error logging, defining custom exception classes,<br>
and ensuring graceful handling. The project adopted the standard Python logging library for its lightweight nature.

#### Issue #6: Consider mensure the latency (Completed: September 12, 2025): 
Latency measurement was implemented for monitoring performance. The author chose an innovative approach to avoid impacting server performance:<br> 
metrics are written to a file and a utility `srpc_show_metrics.py` reads and displays these metrics in real-time.

### 3. Protocol Scope Definition
Defining the Project's Scope.

#### Issue #9: You should fallow the Remote Procedure Call Protocol Specification (WONTFIX: August 25, 2025):
This crucial decision clarified the project's scope. Due to the removal of the XDR library from Python standards,<br>
the author decided not to strictly adhere to RFC 1057 (Sun RPC). Instead, the RPC-LIB was consciously positioned <br>
as a prototyping and academic library rather than a production-ready system,<br>
allowing for faster development and a more tailored focus on distributed systems principles.<br>

## Phase III: Architectural Simplification (October 2025)

The final closed issues focused on refining the architecture to enhance usability and consistency.

#### Issue #12: Adjust name convention (Completed: October 6, 2025): 
To improve code clarity and help the user distinguish between library code and the user own code, a project-wide convention was implemented,<br>
changing the name from 'rpc' to 'srpc' (Simple RPC) in both library and generated files.

#### Issue #11: Encapsulate the binder logic inside server-stub (Completed: October 14, 2025): 
This was a major usability enhancement. The logic for managing the server binder (thread, start, stop)<br>
was fully encapsulated within the generated `SrpcServerStub`. This simplified the user's server setup significantly,<br>
reducing initialization to the elegant, single-line form:

***Before***
```python
# rpc_server.py
from Rpc_Server_Binder import RpcServerBinder
from Calc_rpc_server_stub import RpcServerStub  # from <Modulename>_rpc_server_stub import RpcServerStub
import threading

HOST = "localhost"
server_stub = RpcServerStub(HOST)
binder = RpcServerBinder(HOST)

binder_thread = threading.Thread(target=binder.start_binder, name="binder_thread", daemon=True)
binder_thread.start()

server_stub.start()
input("Server started, press any key to stop...")
binder.stop()
server_stub.stop()
```

***After***
```python 
# server.py
from srpc_calc_server_stub import SrpcCalcServerStub

calcServerStub = SrpcCalcServerStub()
calcServerStub.start()
```
