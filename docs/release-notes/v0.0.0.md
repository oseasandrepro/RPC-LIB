# A History of Closed Issues in the RPC-LIB Project
The RPC-LIB project has undergone a series of significant improvements and bug fixes,<br>
as documented by the following closed issues.<br>
This timeline reflects the project's maturation from its early stages to a more robust and organized state.

## Defining the Project's Scope
### Issue #9: You should fallow the Remote Procedure Call Protocol Specification (Closed 2025-08-26)
This was a pivotal decision for the project's direction.<br>
The issue explore the possibility of adhering to the official RPC protocol specification (RFC 1057) and its use of XDR.<br>
After discovering that Python's standard library no longer supported XDR and considering the complexity,<br>
it was decided not to pursue a strict implementation. Instead,<br>
the project's scope was explicitly defined as a solution for prototyping and academic purposes,<br>
focusing on ease of use and a functional end-to-end solution.

## Early Development & Bug Fixes
### Issue #1: Exception when make exc_class = eval(exc_name) (Closed 2025-08-02)
This was one of the first critical bugs addressed.<br>
The problem stemmed from an incorrect method of handling remote exceptions.<br>
The solution involved refactoring the server-side code to include the exception type in the response,<br>
allowing for proper "Remote Exception Propagation" and ensuring client-side exceptions were correctly raised.<br>

### Issue #3: Server stub try bind the same port for different procedures (Closed 2025-08-02)
Another foundational bug, this issue highlighted a flaw in how the server allocated ports.<br>
The original logic used a random port generator, which could lead to conflicts.<br>
The fix was to leverage the operating system's capability to assign a free port by binding to port 0,<br>
resulting in a more reliable and cleaner implementation.

### Issue #2: Make better logs (Closed 2025-08-03)
This issue was an initial push to improve the project's observability.<br>
The discussion explored options like logging and structlog,<br>
ultimately leading to a decision to use the standard logging library for a lightweight solution.<br>
This issue was later superseded by a broader effort in Issue #4.<br>

## Project Reorganization and Code Quality
### Issue #7: Reorganize the project (Closed 2025-08-03)
A major structural overhaul of the codebase occurred here.<br>
The project's directories were reorganized to separate client and server logic,<br>
improving modularity. A key component of this change was the modularization of the srpc_gen.py script,<br>
which had become too monolithic. This reorganization laid the groundwork for future development.

### Issue #4: Make a review of your error handling approach and Make better logs (Closed 2025-08-08)
Building upon Issue #2, this enhancement focused on a comprehensive review of the project's exception handling.<br>
The goal was to adopt best practices such as using specific exceptions, implementing robust error logging,<br>
and using custom exception classes.<br>
The changes were applied across the core library files and the generated code, solidifying the project's reliability.

## Introducing a Continuous Integration Pipeline
### Issue #8: Add git workflow - PipeLine for CI/CD (Closed 2025-09-04)
To ensure code quality and stability, a continuous integration (CI) pipeline was introduced.<br>
This workflow automates the build, unit tests, and integration tests on every push.<br>
The project adopted Pytest for its testing framework, which provided a unified approach for both unit and integration tests.<br>
The successful implementation of this pipeline marked a significant step toward a more professional development process.

### Issue #10: Consider use pre-commit (Closed 2025-09-10)
Continuing the focus on code quality, this issue introduced pre-commit hooks.<br>
The project now enforces a consistent code style using black (for formatting),<br>
flake8 (for linting), and isort (for sorting imports).<br>
This ensures that all code committed to the repository adheres to a high standard,<br>
preventing style-related debates and maintaining code hygiene.
